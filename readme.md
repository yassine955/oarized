# README for Oarized.com

## Introduction

Welcome to **Oarized.com**, my personal website and portfolio. This site serves as a showcase of my skills, experience, and projects as a web developer and digital strategist. I built this website to not only highlight my professional journey but also to demonstrate my expertise in modern web technologies.

## Website Overview

**Oarized.com** is designed as a clean and minimalistic portfolio site that allows me to share my personal projects, professional experiences, and other relevant information. It reflects my passion for front-end development, particularly in the areas of User Experience (UX), User Interface (UI) design, and web application development.

The website was built using a combination of powerful tools and frameworks:

- **Next.js**: The core framework used to build this site. Next.js allows for server-side rendering, optimizing performance and SEO, and making the website fast and efficient.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the website. Its utility-first approach makes it easy to design responsive and flexible layouts with minimal CSS overhead.
- **WordPress**: WordPress serves as the content management system (CMS) for the site. It enables me to manage and update content easily while keeping the front end decoupled through a headless WordPress setup.
- **GraphQL**: GraphQL is used to query and fetch data from the WordPress back end, allowing for more precise and efficient data management.
- **Apollo Client**: Apollo Client is integrated to handle the GraphQL queries, manage the local cache, and ensure a smooth data-fetching process.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
2. **Dynamic Content**: All content on the site is dynamically fetched from a WordPress CMS using GraphQL and Apollo Client, ensuring that the website can be updated easily without modifying the front end.
3. **SEO Optimization**: With Next.js, the website benefits from server-side rendering, making it more accessible to search engines and improving SEO performance.
4. **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the site has a clean and intuitive interface, making navigation easy and user-friendly.

## Purpose

The main goal of **Oarized.com** is to serve as my professional portfolio, where potential clients, employers, and collaborators can explore my work and learn more about my skills and experience. By building this site, I aimed to create a platform that showcases my expertise in:

- Front-end development (React, Next.js)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Headless CMS and API integration (WordPress, GraphQL, Apollo)

## How It Works

The website fetches content from a WordPress back end using GraphQL queries via Apollo Client. This decoupled architecture ensures flexibility, allowing me to update content via the CMS while keeping the front-end experience lightning-fast through static site generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js.

Tailwind CSS is used for styling, ensuring that the design is responsive, modular, and optimized for performance.
